## Focus on subject matter without pedantry
Central to our approach is a focus on the subject matter itself, rather than on the pedantic details and formalities that often characterize academic writing and publishing. We believe that by emphasizing the substance and significance of ideas, rather than their adherence to narrow disciplinary standards or conventions, we can foster a more vibrant and dynamic intellectual community, one that is better equipped to tackle the complex challenges and questions facing our world today.

We believe that the most valuable and impactful ideas are those that engage directly with the substance and significance of a given topic, rather than getting bogged down in the pedantic details and formalities that often characterize academic writing and publishing.

On our platform, we will encourage authors to focus on the clarity and cogency of their arguments, rather than on strict adherence to disciplinary jargon, citation styles, or formatting requirements. We will provide resources and support to help authors communicate their ideas effectively, using language and formats that are accessible and engaging to a broad audience.

## Accessibility
Too often, academic discourse can become bogged down in jargon, obscurantism, and a focus on form over substance. This can create barriers to entry for those who are not already steeped in the language and conventions of a particular field, and can discourage broader engagement and participation in intellectual life.

We envision a platform that is accessible to anyone with an interest in engaging with and contributing to the advancement of knowledge, regardless of their disciplinary background, institutional affiliation, or level of expertise.

## User-friendly
Our platform will be designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with features that enable easy sharing, commenting, and discussion of ideas.

## Cross-disciplinary dialogue
For example, we will create virtual and physical spaces for cross-disciplinary dialogue and collaboration, such as online forums, workshops, and conferences. We will also explore innovative models for funding and supporting interdisciplinary research projects, such as crowdfunding, grants, and partnerships with industry and civil society organizations.
